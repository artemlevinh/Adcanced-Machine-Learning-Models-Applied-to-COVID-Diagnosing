# Adcanced-Machine-Learning-Models-Applied-to-COVID-Diagnosing

This project aims to develop and evaluate advanced machine learning models for diagnosing COVID-19 based on medical imaging data such as chest X-rays or CT scans. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in quickly and accurately identifying COVID-19 cases, especially in situations where laboratory testing may be limited or unavailable.

Project Overview
The project focuses on the following key components:

Data Collection: Gathering a diverse and representative dataset of medical images, including chest X-rays and CT scans, from confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as non-COVID-19 cases (e.g., pneumonia, normal).

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the medical images to ensure they are standardized and suitable for input into machine learning models. This includes tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Model Development: Developing and training advanced machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or deep learning models, to classify medical images as COVID-19 positive or negative.

Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the developed models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

Deployment: Exploring options for deploying the trained models in real-world healthcare settings, considering factors such as scalability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance.
