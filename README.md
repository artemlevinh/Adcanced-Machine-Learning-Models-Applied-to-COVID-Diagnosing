# Advanced Machine Learning Models Applied to COVID Diagnosing

This project aims to develop and evaluate advanced machine learning models for diagnosing COVID-19 based on medical imaging data such as chest X-rays or CT scans. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in quickly and accurately identifying COVID-19 cases, especially in situations where laboratory testing may be limited or unavailable.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the following key components:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse and representative dataset of medical images, including chest X-rays and CT scans, from confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as non-COVID-19 cases (e.g., pneumonia, normal).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the medical images to ensure they are standardized and suitable for input into machine learning models. This includes tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

3. **Model Development**: Developing and training advanced machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or deep learning models, to classify medical images as COVID-19 positive or negative.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the developed models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

5. **Deployment**: Exploring options for deploying the trained models in real-world healthcare settings, considering factors such as scalability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/artemlevinh/Adcanced-Machine-Learning-Models-Applied-to-COVID-Diagnosing/



Model Development: Develop and train your machine learning models using the prepared data. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your models using the provided evaluation metrics. Fine-tune your models as needed to improve their performance.

Deployment: If applicable, explore options for deploying your trained models in real-world healthcare settings. Consider factors such as data privacy, model interpretability, and regulatory requirements.
